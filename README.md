## WHY EVERY PROGRAMMER SHOULD LEARN GAME DEVELOPMENT?

I found this read to be incredibly interesting! As someone who first got into coding through making small games in Python, I think a lot of what the article talks about holds true. While beginner game development doesn't go in-depth regarding the algorithms and structures, it is still a great introduction to computer science and programming. I also didn't really realize, until reading this article, how much you really learn just by creating what is considered "small and simple" games; especially since some of them can contain more advanced concepts like concurrency and multi-threading.


### Additional Responses

This article provides many solid reasons for a programmer to learn game devlopment, but I believe that most important of all game development brings a level of enjoyment for the programmer and serves as another window to for an individual who is interested in gaming to become interested in programming also.

Wei Luo: Game is regarded as one of the latest art form in human history. With the improvement of graphics and user experiences, modern 3A video games could be the most complex software to be developed. Therefore, it requires software engineers with superior skills.


Nicole Luzuriaga: It's fascinating how game development, even at a beginner level, can expose us to cpmplex concepts in a fun and engaging way. I agree that creating small and simple games can be a rich learning exoperience, as it involves tackling challenges that require a good understanding of certain programming concepts.

Eleazar Neri: I found this article to be incredibly informative. As someone with little to no experience in game development, the authorâ€™s clear explanations and practical insights have piqued my interest. I especially appreciate that the author provides an abundance of resources for those looking to learn more.

Nicholas Meng: I like this article because it really does a good job of illustrating how games are quite complex in terms of the code behind them. I thought it was really interesting how even the most simple games could help one improve their skills with algorithms and datastructures. I also liked that they emphasized a game developer's focus on user experience.
